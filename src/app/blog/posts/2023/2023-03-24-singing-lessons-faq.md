### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What qualifications do your singing teachers hold?

#### Can I reschedule or cancel a singing lesson?

Yes, you can reschedule or cancel a lesson outside of our 24-hour policy. We value our teachers’ time and we hope you will too. Be sure to let your teacher know about any schedule changes as soon as possible.

#### Do you provide any resources or materials to help with practice outside of lessons?

Yes, we provide a variety of resources and materials to help with practice outside of lessons, including old-fashioned books and e-documents. You may need to buy some materials if they are copyrighted or you are taking exams, but we can provide samples.

#### How often do I need to take singing lessons?

#### Is there an extra charge for mobile singing lessons?
