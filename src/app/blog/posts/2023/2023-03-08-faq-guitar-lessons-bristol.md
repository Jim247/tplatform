## Frequently Asked Questions – Guitar Lessons Bristol

### Do I need to bring my own guitar to start lessons?
No, you don't need to bring your own guitar to your first lesson. We can provide one for you to use during the lesson at no extra cost. Once we get to know you and your requirements, we can help you find an appropriate guitar to suit your needs.

### How long are your guitar lessons?
Our lessons start at 30 minutes. If you really want to go into depth, 45 and 60 minutes are good for older children and teens. Adults may wish to push up to 60 minutes if a serious hobbyist. We don't push our customers to take time not needed and we give free advice when needed.

### Is there an extra charge for mobile guitar lessons?
No, mobile lessons cost the same as lessons taken at our location. However, if you live in a remote part of Bristol, we recommend asking friends and neighbors if they would also like to take music lessons to make it worth the trip for our teachers. Many of our teachers are multi-instrumentalists and can teach piano and guitar lessons, for example.

### What happens in my first guitar lesson?
During your first lesson, you'll meet your teacher who will make you feel comfortable and get to know you. We'll talk about your goals and aspirations and come up with a plan to help you improve your playing. By the end of the first lesson, you'll be able to play something new!

### Can my seven-year-old child take guitar lessons?
Absolutely! We believe starting children with their musical journey early in life can have long-term benefits. Our guitar teachers are experienced in teaching younger children and specialize in making lessons fun and engaging.

### Should I take electric or acoustic guitar lessons?
It depends on your goals and the type of music you enjoy. If you'd like to try both types of guitar, let us know and we can arrange this for your first lesson.

### What about bass guitar lessons?
We have some of the finest bass guitar teachers in Bristol, and our founder, James, is an experienced bass guitar player and teacher. If you're interested in learning the bass guitar, please visit our bass guitar page.

### Which brand of guitar should I choose?
Beginner guitars are usually very affordable, and we can help you find a sensibly priced instrument. Some good beginner guitar brands we may suggest are Yamaha, Squier, Epiphone, and Tanglewood.

### How do I tune my guitar?
Your teacher can tune your guitar for you each week, and you'll be able to learn to tune easily with a mobile phone app or electronic tuner once you've settled into your lessons.

### What qualifications do your guitar teachers hold?
All of our guitar teachers are expert players and performers with years of experience in delivering guitar lessons. Some hold a grade 8 certificate, which is the highest level of exam on their instrument. Most have a music degree from a top university, which means they have excellent playing skills. All of our teachers hold valid DBS certificates.

Our guitar teachers are performers who have played at concerts all over the UK and internationally. They have appeared on TV and radio, recorded their own albums, and written their own songs.

### Can I reschedule or cancel a guitar lesson?
Yes, if outside of our 24-hour policy. We value our tutors' time and we hope you will too. Be sure to tell your tutor about your holiday plans in advance.

### Do you provide any resources or materials to help with practice outside of lessons?
Yes, if your lessons are bespoke this will be provided in a variety of forms depending on your need. We like to use old-fashioned books and e-documents where possible to avoid wasted paper. You may need to buy some materials if these are copyrighted, or you're taking grade exams, but we can provide samples.

### How often do I need to take guitar lessons?
90% of our students take weekly lessons, but monthly and ad-hoc lessons are welcome.

### Do you teach music theory in addition to guitar technique?
Yes, we love theory and you will too. When taught as part of an integrated approach, theory will set your guitar playing free!
